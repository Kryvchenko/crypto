          In a decentralized blockchain network, no one has to know or trust
          anyone else. Each member in the network has a copy of the exact same
          data in the form of a distributed ledger. If a memberâ€™s ledger is
          altered or corrupted in any way, it will be rejected by the majority
          of the members in the network.
